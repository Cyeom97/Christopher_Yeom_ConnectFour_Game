## **How to create the game using code**

---

### HTML CSS JS

#### _HTML_

- First you need to create two html files: index.html to link to the web, and I created another called game.html.
- You need to use two html files so you can link and navigate through them.

#### _CSS_

- A CSS file called styles.css is needed in order to style up your game. This is where people can see how game looks like

#### _JavaScript_

- As I mentioned CSS is needed to show people how the game looks like, JavaScript or JS shows how the game operates.
