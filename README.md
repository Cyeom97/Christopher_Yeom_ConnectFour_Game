## **How to create the game using code**

### HTML CSS JS

#### _HTML_

- First you need to create two html files: index.html to link to the web, and I created another called game.html.
- You need to use two html files so you can link and navigate through them.
- In each HTML file, I used a common boilerplate to create a baseline.
- The index.html is used as a display page to welcome users to my page. There is a play button in the bottom that when clicked, it directs to the game.html where you can play the game
- For the index.html, or my display page, I made it really simple by adding a title called "Welcome to my page". Then underneath I wrote a question if the user would like to play Connect 4.
  -Then I created an a tag which displays the word "Play". This is crucial in order to link my index.html to my game.html.
- The "Play" message is an a tag with an href of game.html. So you are able to click the play message and it would transfer to the game.html so the user can play the Connect 4 game.
  -In the game.html,

#### _CSS_

- A CSS file called styles.css was created. It is needed in order to style up your game. This is where people can see how the game looks like.

#### _JavaScript_

- As I mentioned that CSS is needed to show people how the game looks like, JavaScript or JS shows how the game operates.
- I created a js file called script.js and this is where I will make the game come alive by calling variables, functions, and event listeners.
